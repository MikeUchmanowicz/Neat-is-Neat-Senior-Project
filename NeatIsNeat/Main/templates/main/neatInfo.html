            We will be creating a population of AI from a NEAT config file that will be provided in the project files. 
            This config file will determine the AI network’s attributes, like their connection weights (tendencies for certain actions), mutation weights (likeliness to mutate), and population size for each population attempting the game. 
            Once we create the population from the config file, we can pass that population into the main “fitness” function which will allow them to play the game. 
            They will not be given any information on what to do. They will be passed three different inputs: locations of enemies, locations of obstacles, and locations of objectives. 
            They will be given one output option: to change their height. We must increase or decrease the “fitness” of each AI network based on their desirable or undesirable actions. 
            If the AI does what we want, like collecting a worm, we can award it points. If it collides with an enemy or obstacle, we take away points. 
            The main fitness function will end if all AI networks fail by hitting an obstacle or enemy. 
            Their data will be processed by the AI “run” function, a new generation of AI will be created that is hopefully better than the last generation, and they will attempt the main “fitness” function once again. 
            This will loop until an AI is seen as satisfactory by achieving a set fitness score.
